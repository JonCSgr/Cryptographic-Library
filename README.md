# Cryptographic-Library
Includes five different cryptographic ciphers

To run it 
In test.txt you will write your plaintext
In key.txt you will write your key for playfair

Afterwards in the terminal hit the command "make run" and run it using ./run.out
Follow the instructions in terminal afterwards

If you wanna clean the files use "make clean"

E.G
I choose 1 in terminal for 1st encryption algorithm
I choose N=500
Encrypt has been succesfull and there is an output called "encryptedtext.txt" with the encrypted messages

To decrypt follow the same process in reverse
./run.out
Choose 2 which is the decrypt option for the first cipher
Choose N=500 again since that's how you encrypt it in step 1
There is now a file called decryptedtxt.txt with your decrypted message.

There are more encrypted methods, just follow the instructions
